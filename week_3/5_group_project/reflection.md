While I found this challenge enjoyable, I did not learn too much from it as I had done similar things with javascript before. Furthermore, while I don't think the multiple person model was very efficient for this challenge, I can understand its utility in the context of a much large project. That said, I think it would be much simpler if we had "modularized" the challenge, so that each one of the four people were working independently on one function from beginning to end, and then testing each function to ensure that they worked properly, before putting them together. I don't think it was efficient to have each person working on a different stage of development, as in one case, there was an error in the pseudocode that would have been quickly apparent to the person that preceded me if they were writing the code themselves. However, being bound to translate the code directly, it was my job to pass on code that didn't work properly to the next person.
