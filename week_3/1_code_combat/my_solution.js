// Reflection:

//I found this challenge exceedingly frustrating, not because it was difficult (the challenges were generally pretty
//trivial), but because the website kept freezing my browser and having me force a restart. There was too much going on
//on the page at once, and my computer could not handle it. The challenges I completed, however, were fairly interesting.
//Iâ€™m still not totally convinced it is a very efficient method of learning javascript. It uses an interesting analogy
//for objects, but I found creating my own level to be of much more help understanding the object-oriented philosophy
//in javascript.

// Write your reflection here.
