What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?

Ronald and I completed this problem fairly easily; he was the navigator for the most part and I was the driver. It really helped to write it in pseudo code, even though I was a little skeptical at first.

What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

We both knew JS syntax well enough to complete the problem, we really didn't need go out and find other sources.

What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?

The concepts in this challenge were all ones I was familiar with. I'm less clear on the "this" keyword in javascript. I don't see a clear cut advantage of using it over just refering to the variable by name.

Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I'm definitely going to use pseudocode more.

How confident are you with each of the learning objectives?

Very confident.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

As always, I enjoy the logic part, thinking through the problem before we even write anything down. Sometimes I can be slightly slow processor though, so sometimes when I'm thinking through something with someone, they will be a half step ahead of me.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

It was not so tedious, but other problems I've done that are similar to it get tedious fast when you hit a wall and can't figure out how to get past it for hours. Working with a partner helps prevent grinding, though.
