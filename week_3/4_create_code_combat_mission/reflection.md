**What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?**

My partner and I were pretty effective at this challenge, partly because we planned out our code before we even began. We had a good idea of what we wanted our product to be both in english and pseudocode. The only real problems we had were not in the concept, but in the implementation; neither of us were experts in javascript so we had to pause and check out online resources to solve the problems.

**What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

We googled a couple problems, I believe I used the mozilla developer network for one issue.

**What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?**

Conceptually, the challenge was pretty straightforward; the problems were in the limitations of our javascript knowledge.

**Did you learn any new skills or tricks?**

Of course, I learned how to implement a function within an object in javascript.

**How confident are you with each of the learning objectives?**

Confident.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?**

I enjoyed the problem solving aspects, and pretty much every part before debugging.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

Debugging...obviously. It took a fair amount of time tinkering with the code to get it right after we had written it all out.
