# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://zagadooga.github.io/unit1_projects/alecashford-home.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?

I learned it's difficult to fine tune an attractive design with the tools of html and css. This is a skill that I hope I develop further.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

It was fun while conceptualizing it, and then it got more fun the closer the actualy design got to my vision. However, banging my head against the wall, trying to figure out small details, was less fun.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

I created and outline of my code, and then fleshed it out, part by part. Sometimes I would get stuck on one part, so I would switch to another.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I want to make it look more attractive, add more information, and expand it. I hope that the basic design is one I can transfer to all the pages on it, giving it a consistent theme. I want to get it right and make it look good the first time, so that the rest of the pages look good, too.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

It was somewhat difficult, but ultimately not impossible.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
