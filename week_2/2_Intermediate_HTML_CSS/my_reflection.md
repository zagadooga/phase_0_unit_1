# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

Having web standards makes a lot of sense to me, because even if there is no central body enforcing them, it helps everybody if developers afgree amongst themselves to hold themselves to similar standard so that web design is easier to learn and, you don't have to learn entirely new practices for every project.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

It makes sense to me, although a part of me thinkgs that having standard structure can be limiting and prevent you from making websites that are completely out of the box. While it's good to have structures that your guests will be familiar reading, it may hinder creativity in some.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

I do, and I especially like the ability to make your own custom divider names. Because of these, it should be easier to organize your site on your terms, and make it more readable both to you and someone reading your code.

* Why is reset.css necessary?

It is necessary to maintian consistency across browsers.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

I've primarily used firefox and chrome. I did not notice a huge difference, but if browesers interpret web data differently, I generally do not think that is a good thing.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
