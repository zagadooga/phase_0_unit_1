# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

From what I understand, the document object model is an object oriented mode of viewing a web page, a protocol to view the content of the html in javascript. It is not a language, but rather a translation protocol.The advantage seems to be it can be understood and accessed from any object oriented programming language, which is good, but a drawback seems to be that it is an extra, complicated step. I am not sure what it's utility is, so I suppose that's what I still don't understand about it.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

Surprisingly, looking at a wordpress site seemed to have many fewer objects than mine. I don't know if that's because it's built in PHP but HTML sites seem to have more drop down object trees.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

After getting used to it, I found it pretty fun actually. I like how I can instantly see what my tweaks look like; I feel more like an artist as well as a coder.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

It was really helpful to solidfy my understanding seeing which part of the screen were highlighted when you moused over parts of the DOM tree. I understood what parts in the tree corresponded to which parts in the document.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
