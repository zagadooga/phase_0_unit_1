##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS: Elements
  * Javascript Debugging: Sources
  * Performance Optimization: Network

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?

Right click, "inspect element"

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)

#0b0f11, a very dark teal  

  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

Because it is an image (home_bg.gif) so can't be altered in-browser.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? 

An image of time's square.

  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.
  
 I found it using the network tab, reloading the page (while holding shift) and then sortin gthe items that loaded by size. The URL is 92624182-c482-4a35-8da2-4fbf2f502e94_Large_Large.png

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?

Losslessly compresing the images can save 885.9KiB.
