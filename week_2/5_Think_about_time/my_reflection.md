# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?

My biggest time management challenge will be trying to keep one eye on the bigger picture. Often in my past I've found that the most effective way to get into a "get shit done" kind of mindset is to have a crisis brought on from an impending deadline. A common pattern I've noticed is to have a hard deadline come up, and after having procrastinated for most of the time I should have been adressing it, I will have a brief freak-out, panic, accept the situation, and then transition to a cool-headed, "ok, what next" mindset. I'll call it flow. I'm able to be extremely focused and motivated in these situations, and while I can't keep it up indefinitely, I've never been unable to get done what needed doing after one of these events. The hardest part of phase 0 will be trying to do a little bit every day (although it often isn't a "little bit") and maintain this consistantly, because while the weekly deadlines are helpful to keep me consistant, it is impossible to learn the ammount of material we have to cover the night before it's due.

* How will you combat that?

By doing what I've been doing so far: read ahead for the weeks work, estimate how long each challenge will take, and then make a plan of what exercises to have completed by which days. I change these self-imposed deadlines all the time but as long as I'm planning ahead, it should work.

* What techniques will you try?

I may try meditating; an important part of my day is having around an hour before I go to sleep of "me time" to decompress and surf the web or read and just relax. While this is nice, sometimes it's hard to rid my mind of the troubles of the day, and the challenges of tomorrow. I've tried meditating before but I may try it again, in earnest.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

I plan to continue the plan I described in question 2, of planning ahead and trying to stay consistent. It will mean my free time will suffer considerably, but that is sort of what I signed on for anyway. The month of April will be the hardest to stay abreast of the content, since I was originally going to be in the August 4 cohort, but was offered a position in the June 2 group when a space opened up. By the time I accepted I had already planned a lot of things, so I will have to work double time to stay on top of the material and not have to cancel my plans. May is going to be considerably more free for me.
