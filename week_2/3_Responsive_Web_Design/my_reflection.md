# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

Responsive web design is designing your website so that it changes depending on what size screen you're viewing it on, making it easy to read on any device. I find it actually really fun, and is one of my favorite things we've learned so far. It is most definitely a best practice, because I believe mobile devices are the future and are here to stay, so catering our websites to them, at least in part, is a very beneficial and forward-thinking thing to do.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

If smartphones and tablets hadn't been introduced, I doubt we would have gotten around to responsive web design, which would be too bad. It's difficult to predict how the future will go, but I think it's safe to say that all web-based technologies will have a mobile analog soon.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

It is difficult for the visually impaired to use the web, as the web is such a visual medium. There are definitely technologies that can make it possible, but they rely on being able to read the text for the blind person; therefore, I would argue that for creating a universally accesable webpage, text on images should not be considered a best practice.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

I've really liked this idea of responsive web design. What doesn't make sense? So far it seems we've only been learning the important points, but I'm sure at some point I'll come across something that I think is stupid or doesn't make sense.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I found this youtube video fairly helpful for understanding media queries: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi3INcPOvo8
